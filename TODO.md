# TODO: Add Eye Icon to Password Fields

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created PasswordInput component with eye icon toggle
- [x] Updated LoginPage.tsx to use PasswordInput for password field
- [x] Updated Signuppage.tsx to use PasswordInput for password and confirmPassword fields
- [x] Updated ResetPasswordPage.tsx to use PasswordInput for password and confirmPassword fields
- [x] Verified ForgetPasswordPage.tsx has no password fields

## Summary
All password input fields across the application now have an eye icon that toggles password visibility. The default state is hidden, and clicking the eye icon shows/hides the password. The UI remains minimal and consistent with the existing design.
